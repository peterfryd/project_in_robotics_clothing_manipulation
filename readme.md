# Install Realsense SDK 2
Use the following guide:
https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros

I specifically did:
* Step 2 - Option 2: Install librealsense2 (without graphical tools and examples) debian package from ROS servers (Foxy EOL distro is not supported by this option):

* step 3 - Option 2: Install from source

OBS: You might need to update you kernel headers (atleast i did), or change kernel version.
